Thanks to RuneLite and Adam in particular for trying to expose the inner workings of the client. 

It's probably the most useful bit of code in relation to developing third party clients. I appreciate all the work you guys have put into this and I hope it helps more people moving forward. Cheers.

If this has helped you in the building of your client you really should be a patron for RuneLite.
